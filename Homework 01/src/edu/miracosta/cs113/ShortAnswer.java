/**
 * 1. My method finds a solution in fewer than 20 guesses 100% of the time. Yes it does, every time you test 
 * 	  on the first theory it guesses it on the first loop iteration. Every time the second theory is tested 
 *    it takes exactly 20 loop iterations. The third theory is random and there for the number of guesses it 
 *    takes is random, but the method still takes less than 20 guesses every time.
 *
 * 2. My strategy is good because it systematically tries all the combinations in order, increasing the variables 
 *    incrementally.
